3. Review automated price suggestion
4. Adjust pricing if needed
5. Review final details
6. Submit and receive confirmation
7. View in "Awaiting Bids" section

#### Driver Bids on a Load
1. Browse available loads or use search filters
2. View load details (expand card or tap for details)
3. Tap "Bid Now"
4. Enter bid amount (with market range guidance)
5. Add notes if necessary
6. Submit bid
7. Receive confirmation and view in "My Bids" section

#### Load Tracking Flow

3. Views real-time map with truck location
4. Accesses timeline of status updates
5. Optional: Communicates with driver through in-app chat
6. Receives notifications at key journey points
7. Confirms delivery with optional rating

### Gesture Patterns
- **Swipe Actions**: 
  - Swipe load cards for quick actions (cancel, edit, contact)
  - Pull-to-refresh for timely updates
- **Long Press**: 
  - On loads to save or share details
  - On map points to get additional location information
- **Double Tap**: Zoom in on maps
- **Pinch**: Zoom in/out on documents and maps

### In-App Navigation

### Responsive Behavior Guidelines
- Stack elements vertically on smaller screens
- Reduce padding and margins proportionally
- Hide secondary information on smallest screens
- Convert data tables to cards on mobile

- Logical tab order for keyboard navigation
- Visible focus states for all interactive elements
- Properly labeled form fields

### Visual Design
- Color not used as sole indicator (always paired with text/icons)
- Sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Support for dark mode
- Reduced motion option for animations

### Input Methods
- Support for screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Voice input for text fields where appropriate
- Alternative input methods for document uploads

## Prototyping & Testing Plan

### Prototyping Phases
1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**:
   - Paper sketches for initial flow validation
   - Simple clickable prototype for navigation testing
2. **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes**:
   - Grayscale UI with functional interactions
   - User testing focus on information architecture
3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**:
   - Complete visual design with branding
   - Animated transitions and microinteractions
   - Final user testing for visual comprehension

### User Testing Methodology
- **Participant Selection**: 
  - 5-7 users per persona group
  - Mix of tech-savviness levels
  - Geographic distribution matching target market
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Task completion for primary user flows
  - Unguided exploration for discovery assessment
  - A/B testing for critical interactions
- **Metrics to Capture**:
  - Task success rate
  - Time on task
  - Error rate
  - Satisfaction score (SUS)
  - Preference data

### Implementation Handoff
